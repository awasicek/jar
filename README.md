Try to get the longest/biggest series of hexes connected to your home piece!

Try to block your opponent or wall them off with your own pieces!

The object of the game is to have the largest set of contiguous colored hexes stemming from your home location.  In other words, whoever makes a bigger area connected to their home piece is the winner.  Score an additional point for each hex that you control that is contiguous with your home piece.

##How to Play

Players take turns placing their colored markers on any hex.  The first piece each player places is their home piece.  Each piece after the home piece is a standard colored marker.  You will only score points for hexes you control if they are connected to the home piece (either adjacent to the home piece, or adjacent to other pieces that are adjacent to the home piece).

##User Stories
As a player, I want some sort of on-screen indication of whose turn it is.

As a player, I want playing pieces to have some visual and audio feedback so the experience feels more tactile.

As a player, I want some positive feedback for when I win.

##Future Implementations
* Improve styling and animation of memories so it feels more like the user is filling out an actual note card and then it goes in the jar.  A jar's image should update periodically based on the number of memories in it to simulate it filling up.
* Password reset via email.
* Mobile-friendly.
* Ability to send messages to other users.
* Change the way that you look at memories that are in a jar.  A button to show a random memory and another option to see all the memories tiled out and sorted chronologically.

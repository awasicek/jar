The Jar is an app for storing your memories.  It is based on a physical jar that my wife and I created when our daughter was born.  Every so often we put an index card with 2-3 lines describing something that our daughter did that we want to remember or share with her when she is older.  This project is a virtual recreation of this concept.

The Jar is a place where users can make their own jars to put memories in.  Users can create jars for different events, people, or relationships and the jar will be a lasting place to store those memories.  Users can attach a picture to a memory.  

Users can set their jars as private or public.  They can also add other users as contributors to the jar (or just allow specific users to view a jar).

##Example Uses:

* Parents create a jar about their child that they put memories in each time their child does something cute.  

* A couple creates a jar for their wedding and invites all of their guests to contribute memories of the wedding to the jar.

* A football coach creates a jar for his team's season and invites the players to contribute memories to the jar.

* A granddaughter creates a jar to which she adds memories of her grandmother and then shares the jar with her grandmother as a birthday present.

##How to Use

Sign up for an account on the site and then login.  Next, create a jar -- or several jars!  You can then edit the jar's privacy settings and add memories to the jar.  If you like, add other users as contributors or allow another user to view an otherwise private jar.

##User Stories
As a user, I want to attach pictures to my memories.

As a user, I want the jars to feel like physical objects and not just a place to save photos and lines of text.

As a user, I want to share my jars with the people that I choose.

##Future Implementations
* Improve styling and animation of memories so it feels more like the user is filling out an actual note card and then it goes in the jar.  A jar's image should update periodically based on the number of memories in it to simulate it filling up.
* Password reset via email.
* Mobile-friendly.
* Ability to send messages to other users.
* Change the way that you look at memories that are in a jar.  A button to show a random memory and another option to see all the memories tiled out and sorted chronologically.
* Populate the images and memories displayed on a user's personalized home page with that user's own memories and photos.
